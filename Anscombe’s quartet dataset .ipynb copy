    "The Anscombe dataset is comprised of four datasets that are nearly identical in terms of descriptive statistics but appear very different when visualized in a graph. The dataset was created in 1973 by the Englishman Francis Anscombe. Anscombe realized that statistics alone can not fully depict any data set and created this dataset to illustrate his point. Despite the fact that all the datasets have identical variance in x, variance in y, mean of x, mean of y, and linear regression, we can see each set is very different when viewed on a chart. "
